# Huffman Coding
## Compression Algorithm

- In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding.
- This project is about Encode and Decode an input string by using Greedy Algorithm.
- The images below show us how the algorithm works
